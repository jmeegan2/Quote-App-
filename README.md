#  Quote App

This is just a basic quote app that I developed so I could practice connecting to APIs with Swift, Nothing really too intense took me about an hour to make. Used this for reference on connecting to APIs with swift https://levelup.gitconnected.com/swift-making-an-api-call-and-fetching-json-acd364c77a71 and just looked at the SwiftUI documentation for view problems. 

Problems ran into while coding:
* correct spacing between the text elements and centering the quote text
